# Project Setup and Execution Instructions

-This project consists of two components: a web application and an API. To successfully run the project, follow these steps:

-Open the solution and make sure you have both the web application and API projects in the solution.

-Launch both the web application and API projects simultaneously.

-Note: Running both projects concurrently is necessary for the proper functioning of the link shortening system.

-The web application provides a user interface where you can interact with the link shortening system.

-The API project offers authentication functionality through Identity and JWT tokens. This can serve as a foundation for future project enhancements.

-The system allows users to input a URL into a form, and upon submission, the system generates a shortened link.

-Users can then expect to receive the corresponding shortened link, which they can use for sharing or redirection.
